name: getting-started
description: Breaks through task paralysis and analysis paralysis by providing concrete first steps and momentum-building strategies. Use when user says "don't know where to start", "can't get going", "analysis paralysis", "too overwhelming", "stuck", or asks for help breaking down a task, finding the first step, or identifying the easiest thing to do.

# Getting Started

Helps overcome task initiation difficulties by transforming overwhelming situations into actionable first steps.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when detecting:
- **Paralysis phrases**: "I don't know where to begin", "can't get started", "feeling stuck"
- **Overwhelm signals**: "too much", "too complex", "can't see the path"
- **Analysis paralysis**: "too many options", "can't decide", "overthinking this"
- **First step requests**: "what should I do first", "where do I start", "what's the easiest thing"

## Core Approach

### 1. Acknowledge Without Judgment
Start by normalizing the difficulty. Task initiation struggles are real and valid.

### 2. Find the Smallest Viable Action
Identify the absolute smallest thing that creates forward motion. Not "write the report" but "open a blank document and write one sentence about what this report should accomplish."

### 3. Offer Structured Choices
When paralysis comes from too many options, provide 2-3 concrete choices ranked by:
- **Ease** (lowest friction)
- **Impact** (biggest unlock)
- **Momentum** (most likely to lead to next step)

### 4. Build Momentum Scaffolding
Once a first step is chosen, prepare the next 1-2 micro-steps so the path forward is visible.

## Techniques

### The 5-Minute Starter
"Let's do just 5 minutes of [specific micro-task]. No commitment beyond that."
- Set a timer
- Define exactly what "done" looks like for those 5 minutes
- Give permission to stop after (or continue if momentum builds)

### The Easiest Thing First
Identify tasks by energy/friction level:
- **Zero friction**: Already have everything needed, just doing
- **Low friction**: One small setup step, then doing
- **Medium friction**: Need to gather 2-3 things first
- **High friction**: Multiple dependencies or unknowns

Start with zero or low friction items to build confidence.

### Decision Scaffolding
When user is stuck choosing between options:
1. Ask: "Which option requires the least setup right now?"
2. Ask: "Which one are you most curious about?"
3. Ask: "If you had to pick one to try for just 5 minutes, which would it be?"

These questions bypass overthinking and tap into intuition or pragmatism.

### The "Already Done" Trick
Start by writing what's already known/done:
- "You already have [X, Y, Z]"
- "The parts you're clear on are [A, B, C]"
- "You've already accomplished [these related things]"

This reframes from "haven't started" to "partially complete."

### Task Decomposition Pattern
Break down overwhelming tasks using this structure:
```
Big Task → Core Outcome → First Observable Action

Example:
"Write project proposal" →
  "Communicate why this project matters" →
  "Write one sentence: 'This project will...'"
```

## Working with Energy Levels

If user mentions being tired, low energy, or burnt out while trying to start a task:
- Acknowledge this changes the approach
- Suggest consulting the sensing-limits skill for capacity-appropriate tasks
- If they still want to proceed, emphasize the absolute minimum viable action

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Don't suggest "just start" without specifics
❌ Don't minimize the difficulty ("it's easy, just...")
❌ Don't provide elaborate project plans (that's more overwhelm)
❌ Don't assume lack of starting means lack of motivation

## Success Indicators

You've successfully used this skill when:
- User identifies a specific next action they can do now
- User expresses relief or reduced anxiety
- User actually starts doing something (even if tiny)
- User says something like "okay, I can do that"

## Relationship to Other Skills

- **sensing-limits**: Consult when capacity seems limited
- **saving-progress**: Can save momentum state for later resumption
